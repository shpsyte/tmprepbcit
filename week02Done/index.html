        <h1 id="top" style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;" >Welcome to WidgetWerks Inc.</h1>
        <p> WidgetWerks Inc. was formed as part of a consumer conspiracy back in 1973. No one really knew <br>
            what the company did back then but gosh darn it, we had a lot of fun. Based in a secret enclave, <br>
            whereabouts unknown, we wondered if passive anarchy might prove to be counterproductive; <br> 
            so in 1975, we decided to start making stuff.</p>
        
        <p>Now, WidgetWerks Inc. is North America's largest distributor of little black doohickeys (LBDs) <br> 
            and chrome-plated thingamajigs (C-PTs). We pride ourselves on our attention to detail and our superior  <br>
            customer service, and this web site is an extension of our belief in the truism that states <br>
            "there's one born every minute."</p> 
        
        <h2 style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;">Technical Evolution</h2>
        
       <p>Over its thirty year history, WidgetWerks Inc. has come to recognize that the world changes. <br>
           We embrace change, and in recent years we have purchased a fax machine, a Rolodex and even a postal meter.  <br>
           We believe our production line and operational system is second to none, <br>
           and we are constantly on the lookout for new ways to innovate.</p>
        
        <p>In 1992, we expanded operations to include the manufacture of bright orange squishy things (BOSTs), <br>
            addressing a market need that was clearly underrepresented. Thanks to our technological <br>
            evolution, we have remained leaders in this field, and we are planning <br>
            vertical integration into BOST maintenance later this year.</p>

        <h2 style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;">Friends and Neighbors</h2>
        
        <p>In 1980-81, WidgetWerks Inc. realized that in order to be successful, we needed to find <br>
            someone who could actually do the work. By establishing a solid base of core professionals, <br>
            we could plan corporate takeovers, mergers and slumber parties, resulting in <br>
            the establishment of a giant multinational conglomerate. As these professionals slaved away, <br>
            the principals of WidgetWerks Inc. were able to focus on what they were really good at: producing wild-eyed <br>
            theories of economic dominance and consuming mass quantities of daiquiris.</p>
        
        <p>We established a network of companies to produce our products <br>
            (except for the orange squishy things...that's all ours) and have remained in contact ever since. <br>
            They tell us things are going well.</p>
