        <h1 id="top" style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;">Our Partners</h1>

        <p>Our current partners are a bunch of hard-working, gullible stiffs, 
            who really got shafted by our lawyers. Unfortunately for them, they're 
            locked into a long-term deal that gives us the right to exploit their 
            capabilities and intellectual property with little need for compensation. 
            We're rolling in dough over here, I tell you.</p>
        

        <p>In any case, they should consider themselves lucky that we even deigned 
            to mention them here on our spiffy, high-end web offering.</p>
        
        <h2 style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;">Partners we like:</h2>

        <p>Where possible, we have linked to our partners' web sites. 
            If they don't have one, then they probably have something to hide. 
            Unlike us. We're very open...really.</p>
