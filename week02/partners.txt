Our Partners

Our current partners are a bunch of hard-working, gullible stiffs, who really got shafted by our lawyers. Unfortunately for them, they're locked into a long-term deal that gives us the right to exploit their capabilities and intellectual property with little need for compensation. We're rolling in dough over here, I tell you.

In any case, they should consider themselves lucky that we even deigned to mention them here on our spiffy, high-end web offering.

Partners we like:

Clammy's Fine Sprayable Cheese Products

Spineridge ChromeWerks Ltd. (hey, they're name is sorta like ours...)

The Beer Farm at Sprott (Bring the kids!)

Squish Inc.

The Big Black Box Company (makers of fine, big black boxes)

...and these are the people we don't like, but we're stuck doing business anyway. We only mention them to warn you to stay away from them...most of them are idiots.

POW! Propane Products Inc.

NuWave Meat and Meat Byproducts

Guillotine Corp.

London Drugstore Cowboys

Eek Exterminators


Where possible, we have linked to our partners' web sites. If they don't have one, then they probably have something to hide. Unlike us. We're very open...really.
