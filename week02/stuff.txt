Our Stuff

Our stuff is some the finest stuff now available in the industry. While we once dabbled in everything from powder blue pom-poms to purple inflated hammers, our core focus is rooted in little black doohickeys (LBDs) and chrome-plated thingamajigs (C-PTs). In addition, we have recently expanded into the bright orange squishy thing (BOST) market, and market reception has, thus far, been excellent.

Current models of our LBDs include:

LBD 2000

Price: $19.95

LBD 2001
Originally created specifically for Stanley Kubrick, modifications to the design have made it applicable to a wide segment of the population.
