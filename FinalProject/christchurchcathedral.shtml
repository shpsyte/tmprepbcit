            The Cathedral’s motto is Open Doors, Open Hearts, Open Minds. At
            Christ Church Cathedral we hope that by opening our doors, our
            hearts and our minds we might help everyone who comes to us enter
            into a deeper relationship with God, through Christ. We also work to
            make God’s love real and present to this city.

            Growing your faith is an ongoing journey, one that requires support
            from a wider faith community. The Cathedral has several Christian
            formation groups dedicated to strengthening the core values of the
            Christian faith in a variety of ways, and to helping community
            members be attentive to what God may be asking of them. Sign up for
            our weekly newsletter to learn more about the various formation
            opportunities available at the Cathedral.
