          Science World, formally Science World at Telus World of Science, is a science centre run by a not-for-profit
          organization in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
          In early 2017, Science World embarked on a community engagement and consultation process to re-evaluate the
          role of the
          organization over the next generation. Though research, internal consultations and a province-wide community
          engagement
          process, Science World defined a new mission and vision, as well as new strategic pillars that will inform how
          they
          serve the community going forward.

          Mission—Through science and nature, we ignite wonder and empower dreams.

          Vision—Within a generation, Canada will be a country of thriving, sustainable communities rooted in science,
          innovation
          and a deep connection to nature.
