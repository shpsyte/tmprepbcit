          <p>Before you head out the door for you adventure, there’s one important consideration: <b>safety</b>...</p>
        </div>

        <p class="text-news">
          Each year in the province of British Columbia there are over 1,000 search and <b> rescue missions
            initiated.</b> That is more than all the other Canadian provinces combined. Most of these missions become
          necessary due to a <b>lack of preparation</b> by those heading into the backcountry. Vancouver is a beautiful
          city where you can enjoy many different types of outdoor recreation, but please be cautious and prepared
          before heading out. Do not be fooled by your proximity to civilization. Once you step into the backcountry,
          you are truly on your own.</p>

        <p class="text-news">
          Before <b>heading out on any trip</b> you should realize the unexpected can occur on your trip. This includes
          sudden weather changes, injuries, getting lost, and <b>wildlife attacks.</b> For this reason, you must always
          hike with the Ten Essentials (if hiking, or otherwise be properly prepared for your chosen sport). It is also
          good idea to fill out a Trip Plan and leave it with someone you trust, so they know when to expect your return
          and can provide the needed details to authorities if you don’t return.</p>
