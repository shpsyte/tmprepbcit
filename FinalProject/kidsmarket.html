           in 1984, Kids Market transformed a hundred year old building that was originally a paint factory into a magical place for kids with expansive wood-beam ceilings,
          large windows and an airy market design.

          all that Kids Market has to offer to entertain and delight kids of all ages.
          The Kids Market also has a place where you can have your birthday party.  I've never been there, but it looks pretty cool.  If parents want to shop, and their kids hate shopping, they can drop them off at the Adventure Zone.  It has ball pits, slides, punching bags, and probably some other stuff I don't know about.  Also, if it's a hot day, and your kids are tired of playing games, you can head over to the water park.  It has water guns, a playground, waterslides and lots of water sprayers.

          It doesn't cost any money to get into the Kids Market, but you do have to pay for the Adventure Zone and to play the arcade games.  But, like I said before, you can't beat the price (25 cents per game).
