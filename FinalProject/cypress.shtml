          The ski area was initially opened by BC Parks in the 1970s, after
          two Murray-Latta double-chairs were constructed on Mt. Strachan and
          Black Mountain. Night skiing was initially added in 1985 on those
          two chairs. In 1987, the Sky Chair was installed at the peak of Mt.
          Strachan, opening up new terrain and reaching the highest point on
          either mountain. The chair was a Mueller double relocated from Apex
          Mountain Resort.

          Cypress was the first ski resort in BC to allow snowboarding, doing
          so on March 15, 1987.
