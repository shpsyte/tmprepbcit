            The Contemporary Art Gallery is an internationally acclaimed venue
            located in Vancouver, Canada and provides free admission to all.

          <p class="text-news">
            The Contemporary Art Gallery (CAG) is an independent, non-profit
            public art gallery and one of Canada’s leading venues for
            contemporary art. Offering free access to everyone, we work with
            artists from Canada and around the world to produce exhibitions,
            off-site projects, residencies, learning, outreach, community
            engagement programs, events and publications. Each of these
            interdependent strands of programming varies in scale, duration and
            location to challenge how and where we might engage with
            contemporary visual art.

          <p class="text-news">
            Located alongside our Book Shop is a visitor Resource Room,
            providing interpretive and contextual materials supporting our
            exhibitions, off-site projects and residencies. These resources
            include specially made artist files, books, texts and videos that
            open up multiple entry points into the work on display.

          <h2>Off-site</h2>
          <p class="text-news">
            As well as housing exhibitions within the gallery, CAG hosts
            additional off-site exhibitions at various locations year round. Our
            permanent off-site location is at Yaletown-Roundhouse Station on the
            corner of Mainland and Davie Streets. This public exhibition space
            facilitates the extension of our programming beyond the confines of
            the gallery and into the public realm, engaging with broader
            audiences and challenging conceptions of public art displays.
