            Vancouver's public beaches and waterfront access make it among the
            most liveable cities in the world. The Park Board advocates for
            access to our most precious asset: the waterfront. Starting in the
            1920s, park commissioners made it a priority to incrementally
            acquire beachfront property that was earlier snapped-up for hotel
            and private residential development. By the mid-1980s we had
            acquired full waterfront access along English Bay from Burrard
            Bridge to Stanley Park and all the waterfront from Spanish Banks to
            Jericho Beach. Inroads had been made along Point Grey Road with a
            handful of street-end lookouts.

          <p class="text-news">
            Beach water quality is monitored for E-coli bacteria counts every
            week from May to September by Vancouver Coastal Health and Metro
            Vancouver.
