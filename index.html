     <h2 style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline; text-align: center;">Why this course</h2>
     <p style="font-size:20px;">
        I worked as a backend developer and in some project, I missed what is <em>"Frontend"</em>.<br>
        This is the first reason about why I take this curse...<br>
        I hope to learn the core about design and HTML, so, I can <strong>run my personal project.</strong>
