<h1>Our Stuff</h1>

<hr>

<p>Our stuff is some the finest stuff now available in the industry. While we once dabbled in everything from powder blue pom-poms to purple inflated hammers, our core focus is rooted in little black doohickeys (LBDs) and chrome-plated thingamajigs (C-PTs). In addition, we have recently expanded into the bright orange squishy thing (BOST) market, and market reception has, thus far, been excellent.</p>

<p>Current models of our LBDs include:</p>
