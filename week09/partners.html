		<p>Our current partners are a bunch of hard-working, gullible stiffs, who really got shafted by our lawyers. Unfortunately for them, they're locked into a long-term deal that gives us the right to exploit their capabilities and intellectual property with little need for compensation. We're rolling in dough over here, I tell you.</p>
		
		<p>In any case, they should consider themselves lucky that we even deigned to mention them here on our spiffy, high-end web offering.</p>
		
		<p>Partners we like:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Clammy's Fine Sprayable Cheese Products</li>
		<li>Spineridge ChromeWerks Ltd. (hey, they're name is sorta like ours...)</li>
		<li>The Beer Farm at Sprott (Bring the kids!)</li>
		<li>Squish Inc.</li>
		<li>The Big Black Box Company (makers of fine, big black boxes)</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>...and these are the people we don't like, but we're stuck doing business anyway. We only mention them to warn you to stay away from them...most of them are idiots.</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>POW! Propane Products Inc.</li>
		<li>NuWave Meat and Meat Byproducts</li>
		<li>Guillotine Corp.</li>
		<li>London Drugstore Cowboys</li>
		<li>Eek Exterminators</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Where possible, we have linked to our partners' web sites. If they don't have one, then they probably have something to hide. Unlike us. We're very open...really.</p>
