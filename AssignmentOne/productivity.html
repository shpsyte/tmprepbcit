    <h2 class="title clear">How increase your productivity at work.</h2>

    <p>What's Up Developers, I will share here a simple technique to increase your productivity at work</p>
    <p class="small">Before we move on let me clarify, this is based on a Scientifique Technique, at the end of this article, I'll share some sources about it.</p>
    
    <div class="content">

        <h2>Do PAUSE between a work period time!</h2>

        <p>This is a simple technique that will help you to become more productive.
        <br> The source about it says that every <b>90 minutes</b> you need to stop for <b>20 minutes</b>, in fact, <br>
        another technique the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a> says every <b>25 minutes</b> you need to be stoped for <b>5 minutes</b>.</p>

        <p>If you look for the numbers is near about <strong>20%</strong> of free time in working time.</p>
        
        <p>
        The point here is how many hours do I need to work to be more productive and make my pause? I mean, 90 minutes is too much? is enough? and the answer is I don't know! Try youself and test.</p>

        
        <h3>How to search for my best work period of time?</h3>
        
        <p>This is an important question, and you need to be a Scientist of your own! 
        You need to know the logic about it:</p>
        <h3>Work + Pause + Work + Pause + Work + Pause + Work + Pause</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>When you're working you need to stay FOCUSED, maximum as you can!</li>
          <li>When you're pausing, you can do anything, play video games, wast time on social media, books.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For me, I stay focused around 2 hours and get 15 minutes of free time and it's working! My suggestion to you is: Try 25-5, You felt that you stay focus? I mean, your mind didn't fly away? if not, try to <strong>increase</strong> this time, if yes try to <strong>reduce</strong>.</p>


        <h2>Drink Whater!</h2>

        <p>Ahhh, Come on!!! Whater???</p>
        <p> Yes, just drink whater, think in this way:</p>

        <p>When your smartphone is with low battery all application, functionality, background notification 
        is put in sleep, what happens here is your smartphone is trying to save your battery. </p>

        <p>It is the same with our body...</p>

        <p>When you are with low water in your body, your brain put to sleep some cognitive functions, therefore, is saved your power of think. </p>
