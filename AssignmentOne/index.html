     <h2 style="color:blueviolet; text-decoration: overline underline;">Why this course</h2>
     <p style="font-size:20px;">
        I worked as a backend developer and in some project, I missed what is <em>"Frontend"</em>.<br>
        This is the first reason about why I take this curse...<br>
        I hope to learn the core about design and HTML, so, I can <strong>run my personal project.</strong>
     </p>

           <li><strong>run my personal project.</strong></li>
           <li>Taking a conversation with a Frontend and understand what are they talking about..</li>
        
        </ol>
