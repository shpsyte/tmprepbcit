	<h1 class="clearall">Our Partners</h1>

<p><img src="images/partners.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="" class="contentimage">Our current partners are a bunch of hard-working, gullible stiffs, who really got shafted by our lawyers. Unfortunately for them, they're locked into a long-term deal that gives us the right to exploit their capabilities and intellectual property with little need for compensation. We're rolling in dough over here, I tell you.</p>

<p>In any case, they should consider themselves lucky that we even deigned to mention them here on our spiffy, high-end web offering.</p>

<p>Partners we like:</p>


<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Partner</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Clammy's Fine Sprayable Cheese Products</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Spineridge ChromeWerks Ltd. (hey, they're name is sorta like ours...)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The Beer Farm at Sprott (Bring the kids!)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Squish Inc.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The Big Black Box Company (makers of fine, big black boxes)</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>...and these are the people we don't like, but we're stuck doing business anyway. We only mention them to warn you to stay away from them...most of them are idiots.</p>


<table border="1">
	<tr>
		<th>Issues</th>
	</tr>
	<tr><td>POW! Propane Products Inc.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>NuWave Meat and Meat Byproducts</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Guillotine Corp.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>London Drugstore Cowboys</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Eek Exterminators</td></tr>

</table>


<p>Where possible, we have linked to our partners' web sites. If they don't have one, then they probably have something to hide. Unlike us. We're very open...really.</p>
